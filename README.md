# Ninja-Se
Ninja-Se is a puzzle game that involves moving around the board to unlock doors and escape. The player is represented by a purple square and can move from one cell to another. Cells that are colored black are walls and prevent movement. Some cells have keys in them, which are shown as a small colored square within a cell. There is a corresponding locked wall (with the same color and missing color in the center of the cell) for each key. If the player is in a cell with a key, they can pick it up. Only one cell can be held at a time, so requesting to pick up a key if one is already held will result in the previously held key being dropped. The player must unlock all locked doors to escape the room.
